# Welcome to my GitHub Account!

Hey, I'm Airis (Saria Mostafa) and this is my personal GitHub account where I share some of my projects and code snippets.

## Interests

- Physics: Ever since I was a child, I had a huge interest in Physics. As I was very curious and often found myself questioning the way our world works, Physics always gave me a fundamental answer, which is it one of the things I wish to pursue in life. Who knows, I might find that answer to some curious kid's wish one day.
- Simulations: Creating simulations allows me to bring theoretical concepts to life, providing a visual representation and enhancing my understanding.
- Problem Solving: I thrive on challenging problems that require analytical thinking and creative solutions.
- Learning: I have an insatiable curiosity and continuously seek knowledge to expand my horizons.

## Projects

Here are a few of the projects I'm currently working on:

- A tracking Algorithm for fusion reactors
- Physics Simulations repository for Educators
