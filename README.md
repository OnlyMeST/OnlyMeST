- Greetings Mortal, you can call me ST
- I am a Highschool student who does some projects on the side
- I play with fields like file encryption and game design mostly
- I'll share every project I'm going to code for the public for the sake of it
- Hopefully you find something helpful here or you can also help me improve my code
- Have fun ;)
